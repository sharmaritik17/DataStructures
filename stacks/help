 ```java
 
Initialize three pointers prev as NULL, curr as head and next as NULL.
Iterate trough the linked list. In loop, do following.

// Before changing next of current,
// store next node
next = curr->next

// Now change next of current
// This is where actual reversing happens
curr->next = prev

// Move prev and curr one step forward
prev = curr
curr = next

```

```cpp
class Node {
	public:
	int data;
	Node *next
};
```
